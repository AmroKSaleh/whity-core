/**
 * Optional frontend feature declaration for plugins (SDK v1.2; `'embed'`
 * screens and multipart `action` file fields added in SDK v1.13, #246/#247).
 *
 * A plugin MAY implement this interface — in addition to
 * {@see PluginInterface} — to describe the admin-UI screens it contributes.
 * Like {@see PluginRequirementsInterface}, it is a sibling capability
 * interface: PluginInterface itself stays backend-only and plugins that do
 * not implement this load exactly as before.
 *
 * Descriptors are UI METADATA ONLY — they grant NOTHING. Data access is
 * always enforced by the route-level RBAC of the underlying API routes
 * (`requiredRole` / `requiredPermission` on the plugin's route declarations);
 * the host additionally filters the descriptor listing per caller server-side
 * (`GET /api/frontend/features` only returns descriptors whose
 * `requiredPermission` the caller actually holds).
 *
 * Descriptor shape
 * ----------------
 * Each entry of the returned list is an associative array:
 *
 * - `id` (string, REQUIRED): unique kebab-case slug matching
 *   `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`. Ids are unique across ALL plugins; when two
 *   plugins claim the same id the host keeps the first (discovery order),
 *   drops the duplicate, and logs a warning.
 * - `label` (string, REQUIRED, non-empty): human-readable menu/screen title.
 * - `screen` (string, REQUIRED): one of
 *   - `'crud'` — the host renders a schema-driven list/create/edit/delete
 *     screen over the declared `resource`;
 *   - `'action'` — the host renders a generic form (declared by `action.fields`)
 *     that submits a JSON body to the plugin's `action.{method,path}` route and
 *     either downloads a returned file (response carries `Content-Disposition`)
 *     or shows the returned JSON report — for upload/transform/run-style tools
 *     that are not CRUD resources, with zero per-app frontend code;
 *   - `'custom'` — the host application must register a bespoke component for
 *     this id in its UI registry, otherwise a placeholder renders.
 *   - `'embed'` — the host renders an iframe pointed at the plugin's own
 *     declared `embed.path` route (RBAC-protected like any other plugin
 *     route) — for a bespoke UI a backend-only, deploy-copied plugin can ship
 *     with ZERO host-application edits, unlike `'custom'`. The framed
 *     response can be any self-contained HTML document (inline
 *     `<script>`/`<style>`); it is NOT constrained to the strict JSON-API
 *     default `Content-Security-Policy`/`X-Frame-Options` — the host lets a
 *     handler-set CSP with a non-`'none'` `frame-ancestors` survive, and also
 *     drops the legacy `X-Frame-Options: DENY` in that case.
 * - `requiredPermission` (string, REQUIRED — fail-closed, there are no
 *   permissionless screens): must match
 *   `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*:[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/` and be a permission this plugin
 *   genuinely OWNS. Ownership is not self-asserted: the permission must be
 *   declared via {@see PluginInterface::getPermissions()}, must NOT be a core
 *   permission name (self-declaring e.g. `users:read` does not make it
 *   ownable), and across plugins the FIRST declarant (discovery order) owns
 *   a name — a later plugin re-declaring it cannot gate descriptors on it.
 *   Anything else is REJECTED: a plugin cannot expose a screen over someone
 *   else's resource. The host enforces the permission server-side when
 *   exposing the descriptor to a caller.
 * - `resource` (array, REQUIRED when `screen` is `'crud'`; optional metadata
 *   for `'custom'` screens, validated identically when present):
 *     - `basePath` (string): the plugin's OWN REST collection path, starting
 *       with `'/api/'`, e.g. `'/api/hello/greetings'`. The host validates
 *       that the plugin ACTUALLY REGISTERED a GET route at exactly this path
 *       — a declared route the host refused (for example a path collision
 *       with a core route; first registration wins) does not count — and
 *       that this GET route's own `requiredPermission` EQUALS the
 *       descriptor's. A path the plugin does not serve, or a menu gate that
 *       differs from the data route's gate, is REJECTED.
 *     - `titleField` (string, optional): the item field used as the display
 *       name in confirmations.
 * - `action` (array, REQUIRED when `screen` is `'action'`): describes the form
 *   and where it submits:
 *     - `method` (string): `'POST'` or `'PUT'`.
 *     - `path` (string): the plugin's OWN handler path, starting with `'/api/'`.
 *       Validated like `resource.basePath` but against the plugin's ACTUALLY
 *       REGISTERED POST/PUT routes, and that route's `requiredPermission` must
 *       EQUAL the descriptor's.
 *     - `fields` (list, optional): the inputs the form renders, each
 *       `{name, label?, kind?: 'text'|'textarea'|'file', accept?, required?}`.
 *       When ANY field is `kind: 'file'`, the host submits the whole form as
 *       real `multipart/form-data` (file fields as actual binary parts, other
 *       fields as plain form fields) instead of JSON — read it via the
 *       standard SDK `Request::getUploadedFiles()`, the same mechanism the
 *       core plugin-upload route already uses. A descriptor with no `'file'`
 *       field submits as JSON exactly as before (non-breaking).
 *     - `submitLabel` (string, optional): the submit button label.
 * - `embed` (array, REQUIRED when `screen` is `'embed'`):
 *     - `path` (string): the plugin's OWN GET route, starting with `'/api/'`.
 *       Validated identically to `resource.basePath` — the plugin must have
 *       ACTUALLY REGISTERED this GET route, and its own `requiredPermission`
 *       must EQUAL the descriptor's.
 * - `icon` (string, optional): kebab-case tabler icon name. Default: none.
 * - `group` (string, optional non-empty): navigation group. Default `'plugins'`.
 * - `order` (int, optional): sort order within the group. Default `100`.
 *
 * An invalid descriptor is DROPPED by the host with a logged warning naming
 * the plugin, the descriptor id (when present) and the exact reason; the
 * plugin itself still loads — descriptors are UI metadata, never a load gate.
