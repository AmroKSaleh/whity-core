# whity/plugin-sdk

The standalone plugin contract package for the Whity platform. A plugin
implements the SDK types — and depends on **nothing else**: this package
requires only PHP, never `whity-core`. That is what makes a plugin
distributable across Whity-based applications (KeyHub, Elmak, …) without
dragging a host framework along.

## Contract surface (v1.0.0)

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Whity\Sdk\PluginInterface` | The plugin contract: name/version, routes, permissions, hooks, migrations. |
| `Whity\Sdk\MigrationInterface` | Plugin schema migrations: `up(\PDO)` / `down(\PDO)`, idempotent statements, tested rollback. |
| `Whity\Sdk\Http\Request` | The request shape route handlers receive (headers, body, per-request attribute bag incl. `ATTR_JWT_CLAIMS`). |
| `Whity\Sdk\Http\Response` | The response shape handlers return; `Response::json()` / `Response::error()` factories. |
| `Whity\Sdk\Hooks\Events` | Catalogue of hook event names (`user.creating`, `tenant.deleted`, `worker.request.start`, …). |

Versioning is semantic and **additive**: new events/optional capabilities land
in minor versions (1.1, 1.2, …); breaking contract changes require a major.

## Minimal plugin

```php
use Whity\Sdk\PluginInterface;
use Whity\Sdk\Http\Request;
use Whity\Sdk\Http\Response;
use Whity\Sdk\Hooks\Events;

final class MyPlugin implements PluginInterface
{
    public function getName(): string { return 'MyPlugin'; }
    public function getVersion(): string { return '1.0.0'; }

    public function getRoutes(): array
    {
        return [[
            'method' => 'GET',
            'path' => '/api/my/hello',
            'handler' => fn (Request $r): Response => Response::json(['ok' => true]),
            'requiredRole' => null,
        ]];
    }

    public function getPermissions(): array { return ['my:view']; }
    public function getHooks(): array { return [Events::USER_CREATING => fn (array $d, array $c): array => $d]; }
    public function getMigrations(): array { return []; }
}
```

## Packaging & distribution mechanism

This package lives in the `whity-core` monorepo under `sdk/` and is consumed
through a **composer path repository** — the exact mechanism a distributable
plugin (and the host apps that install it) reuses:

1. **Inside whity-core (this repo):** the root `composer.json` declares

   ```json
   "repositories": [{ "type": "path", "url": "sdk" }],
   "require": { "whity/plugin-sdk": "^1.0" }
   ```

   Composer links `sdk/` into `vendor/whity/plugin-sdk`, so `Whity\Sdk\…`
   autoloads exactly like any third-party package. The SDK owns the
   `Whity\Sdk\` autoload root — no other package may map that prefix.

2. **A distributable plugin package** requires the contract, not the host:

   ```json
   "require": { "whity/plugin-sdk": "^1.0" }
   ```

3. **A host application installing a plugin** adds the plugin (and
   transitively the SDK) through the same path-repository mechanism while the
   packages are co-developed:

   ```json
   "repositories": [
     { "type": "path", "url": "../whity-core/sdk" },
     { "type": "path", "url": "../whity-plugin-something" }
   ]
   ```

   Publishing to a private Composer repository (or extracting `sdk/` with
   `git subtree split`) later changes only the `repositories` entry — the
   `require` constraints and all plugin code stay identical. This is the same
   mechanism the extract-once/consume-twice pilot uses for distribution.

## License

MIT — deliberately permissive so plugin authors are not bound by the host
framework's license.
