# Whity Tauri Desktop Template

A working Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript desktop app boilerplate wired to
Whity's shared UI/feature packages (`@amroksaleh/ui`, `@amroksaleh/features`,
`@amroksaleh/tokens`) — start here instead of `create-tauri-app`'s stock
scaffold when building a Whity-based desktop product.

It demonstrates, end to end, the two things every downstream desktop app
needs:

1. **The multi-client feature-extraction pattern** (see `packages/features`):
   the exact same `DemoCatalogList`/`DemoCatalogDetail` components web/
   renders against a server API render here, unmodified, against a **real
   local SQLite database** — no server, no Node, fully offline. Only
   `src/demo-catalog-tauri-adapter.ts` differs from web's server-backed
   adapter or the Vite SPA harness's in-memory one.
2. **Adding native capabilities via Rust crates** — a printer command
   (`src-tauri/src/commands/printer.rs`, backed by the `printers` crate) as a
   real, working example of the extension pattern: something a plain web app
   cannot do, added as one crate + one `#[tauri::command]`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

This opens a desktop window with a sidebar (Home / Demo Catalog / Printer
demo). The Demo Catalog list/create/edit flow persists to a real SQLite file
in your OS's per-app data directory (see `src-tauri/src/db.rs`) — close the
app and reopen it, your data is still there.

## Project layout

```
src/                          # Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)
  App.tsx                     # Route switch + AppSidebar/PageShell wiring
  nav-config.tsx              # The app's nav, as plain data (see the nav contract below)
  demo-catalog-tauri-adapter.ts  # DemoCatalogAdapter -> Tauri invoke() -> Rust commands
  printer-demo.tsx             # UI for the printer command example
  hash-link.tsx / use-hash-path.ts  # Minimal zero-dependency router (swap for react-router as you grow)

src-tauri/                    # Backend (Rust)
  src/
    lib.rs                    # Tauri::Builder setup, command registration
    db.rs                     # SQLite connection + schema migration
    commands/
      items.rs                # list_items / get_item / save_item (DemoCatalog)
      printer.rs               # print_text (the native-crate example)
```

## The adapter pattern (why this matters)

`DemoCatalogList`/`DemoCatalogDetail` (from `@amroksaleh/features/demo-catalog`)
never fetch data directly. They take an injected `DemoCatalogAdapter`:

```ts
interface DemoCatalogAdapter {
  list(): Promise<DemoCatalogItem[]>
  get(id: number): Promise<DemoCatalogItem | null>
  save(input: DemoCatalogItemInput): Promise<DemoCatalogItem>
}
```

- **web/** implements this against a server REST API (cookie-authenticated `fetch`).
- **packages/spa-harness** implements this against an in-memory array (for a quick browser demo, no backend at all).
- **this template** implements this against real local SQLite via three Tauri commands.

Same UI code, three different data sources, zero changes to the components
themselves. When you build your own feature, follow this same shape: define
a small adapter interface, implement the presentational components against
it, and give each client (web/desktop/mobile) its own implementation.

**No reconciliation/versioning story**: `save_item` is last-writer-wins with
no version check — fine for this single-device demo, but if you're building
a real multi-device offline-sync feature you need to design conflict
resolution yourself (see the note on `DemoCatalogItemInput` in
`src-tauri/src/commands/items.rs`).

**Alternative to hand-rolled commands**: this template writes one Rust
command per operation (`list_items`/`get_item`/`save_item`) for compile-time
type safety end to end. If your app has many entities and you'd rather trade
that safety for less boilerplate,
[`tauri-plugin-sql`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-sql) (the
official community SQL plugin) lets the frontend execute SQL directly against
a managed connection without a dedicated command per query. Either is valid —
if you're already using `tauri-plugin-sql` elsewhere, there's no need to
migrate to match this template.

## Adding your own native capability (the printer recipe)

The printer command follows a four-step recipe — repeat it for any capability
a plain web app can't do (filesystem access beyond the sandbox, USB/serial
devices, OS-level integrations, etc.):

1. **Add the crate** to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`'s `[dependencies]`.
2. **Write a command**:
   ```rust
   #[tauri::command]
   pub fn your_command(arg: String) -> Result<String, String> {
       // ... call your crate ...
   }
   ```
   Return `Result<T, String>` (or any `Serialize` type) — Tauri handles the
   JS ↔ Rust (de)serialization automatically, including camelCase argument
   names on the JS side matching your Rust parameter names.
3. **Register it** in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`'s `tauri::generate_handler![...]` list.
4. **Call it from the frontend**:
   ```ts
   import { invoke } from "@tauri-apps/api/core"
   const result = await invoke<string>("your_command", { arg: "..." })
   ```

If the capability needs shared state (a DB connection, a device handle,
etc.), manage it the way `db.rs`/`lib.rs` do: build it once in `.setup(...)`,
then `app.manage(...)` it, and receive it in your commands via
`State<'_, YourType>`.

## The nav contract

`AppSidebar`/`PageHeader`/`PageShell` (from `@amroksaleh/ui`) are
presentational only — no Next.js, no router opinion. `nav-config.tsx`
authors the sidebar as plain data; `resolveNavGroups()`
(`@amroksaleh/features/nav`) resolves it against the current path and an
optional translator. `hash-link.tsx` is the `NavLinkAdapter` — swap it for
`react-router`'s `<Link>` (or anything else) by implementing the same
`{ href, children, ...props }` contract. See `packages/features/README.md`
for the full contract documentation.

## Monorepo note

This template's `package.json` currently points `@amroksaleh/ui`/
`@amroksaleh/features`/`@amroksaleh/tokens` at `file:../../packages/...` —
correct while this template lives inside the whity-core monorepo (so CI
always tests it against the latest package source). **If you copy this
directory out as the start of a new project**, switch those three to the
published version ranges instead (e.g. `"@amroksaleh/ui": "^0.3.1"`,
matching `packages/ui/package.json`'s own `publishConfig` registry) — the
`file:` paths won't resolve outside this monorepo.

## Icons

Placeholder icons are checked in under `src-tauri/icons/` so `npm run tauri
build` works out of the box. Replace them with your own brand icon via:

```bash
npx tauri icon path/to/your-logo.png
```

## Verified

This template's Rust side was verified with `cargo check` and `cargo build`
inside a disposable `rust:1-bookworm` container with the Tauri v2 Linux
system dependencies installed (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`,
`libayatana-appindicator3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, `libssl-dev`,
`libsqlite3-dev`, `libcups2-dev`, `pkg-config`) — not just written by hand.
The frontend was verified with `tsc --noEmit` and a real `vite build`.

### Known gaps — not yet verified

- **Windows.** Not yet built/run natively. Printing especially is the most
  OS-divergent capability here (Print Spooler vs. CUPS vs. Core Graphics) —
  don't assume the Linux verification above generalizes. Building natively
  requires the MSVC C++ build tools (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`
  with the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools` component), which need
  an elevated (Administrator) install — that blocked an attempt to verify
  this from an unattended session. Whoever picks this up next: install Rust
  (`rustup`) + the VS Build Tools workload above, then
  `cd templates/tauri-desktop && npm install && npm run tauri build`, and
  specifically exercise the printer command against a real Windows printer
  (or "Microsoft Print to PDF").
- **macOS.** Deliberately deferred, not attempted at all yet — a distinct
  follow-up stage, not scheduled as part of this pass.
- **Packaging size / startup time.** Not measured on any platform — depends
  on the platform builds above existing first. Once a real `tauri build`
  output exists (Windows installer, macOS `.app`/`.dmg`, or the Linux
  AppImage/deb), report actual installer size and cold-start time here rather
  than leaving each downstream consumer to measure it independently.
